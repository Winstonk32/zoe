        <div class="conversation">
            <p><strong>P:</strong> Do I ask you first?</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> Sure</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> What's simply, is your current goal?</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> To find a well-paying job in order to be able to depend on myself alone</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> What deadline or timeline are you working with to help you achieve this goal?</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> I'm using the end of my studies in college as a deadline</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> How is the journey so far? Any challenges?</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> It's not off to the best start but then again, which journey is? My lack of experience is making it hard to find a place willing to take me in.</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> I guess lack of experience is the number one setback when job hunting, but we have to keep pressing on and not give up.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> True</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> What possible options do you have for you to be successful in achieving your goal? Maybe list 2 or 3 options.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> I could gain relevant work experience through internships, even if they are unpaid.<br>
            I could also enhance my resume with online courses and certifications in any areas of interest.<br>
            And maybe build transferable skills and show commitment by volunteering.</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> All those are excellent steps.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> I did my research and got advice from different people about how to improve my CV.</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> What is the absolute way forward to help you achieve the goal you stated earlier? Start with "I will..."</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> I will actively seek internships and volunteer opportunities to gain relevant experience, enroll in online courses to enhance my skills, and network with professionals in my field to increase my job prospects.</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> That is guaranteed to propel you in the right direction.</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> I can't thank you enough for taking time to answer my questions. Thank you so much.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> It's no problem.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> Shall I ask now?</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> Go ahead</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> Tell me about a goal that you have either for this class, or for your career in the next year or so.</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> For this class, I plan to take the rest of the year after we finish the lessons to revise the course content and start job applications for VA positions come January. For my career beyond being a VA I dream of becoming a Full Stack Engineer, specializing in Web Development.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> Wow, that sounds impressive.</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> Thank you.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> Is your goal S.M.A.R.T.? (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound?)</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> It is. For VA it's easy to follow since all we have to do is follow their schedule. For the FSE it requires a lot of discipline to follow through since no one is following up on you.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> Alright</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> What is your current reality (R)? Is there a barrier that might block you from achieving your goal?</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> I'm currently having a challenge in time management. I have a small baby so getting some quiet time is a task, at least for the VA. For the FSE, self-motivation is the main challenge since no one is pushing you. Let's not forget Kenya Power in all this.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> Very true.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> Do you get assistance from anyone regarding the baby?</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> I do, but being at home all the time he is attached to me. As we speak he is right beside me.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> Ohh ok</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> What are some options (O) that you have to minimize or eliminate that barrier, and to make it more likely that you’ll achieve your goal? Can you list 3 or 4 options?</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> I have someone who watches him sometimes so that I can put in the work. I plan to start going through the lessons early in the morning before he's up. For Kenya Power I plan to monitor their social media pages to plan for alternatives in case of scheduled maintenance. For self-motivation, I plan to remember my 'why' moving forward.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> That’s a pretty good plan.</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> Thank you.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> What is the absolute way forward to help you achieve the goal you stated earlier? Start with "I will..."</p>
            <p><strong>P:</strong> I will prioritize this course more to ensure I don't rush over the coursework, and to also ensure that I will always submit my assignments in good time to avoid the deadline rush.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> Sounds like a plan.</p>
            <p><strong>Z:</strong> I think that's all the questions.</p>
